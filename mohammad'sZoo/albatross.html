        Albatrosses, of the biological family Diomedeidae, are large seabirds related to the procellariids, 
        storm petrels, and diving petrels in the order Procellariiformes (the tubenoses). They range widely 
        in the Southern Ocean and the North Pacific. They are absent from the North Atlantic, although fossil 
        remains show they once occurred there and occasional vagrants are found. Albatrosses are among the 
        largest of flying birds, and species of the genus Diomedea (great albatrosses) have the longest wingspans
        of any extant birds, reaching up to 3.7 m (12 ft). The albatrosses are usually regarded as falling into 
        four genera, but disagreement exists over the number of species.
