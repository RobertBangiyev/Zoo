        The lion (Panthera leo) is a large cat of the genus Panthera native to Africa and India. 
        It has a muscular, deep-chested body, short, rounded head, round ears, and a hairy tuft 
        at the end of its tail. It is sexually dimorphic; adult male lions are larger than females
        and have a prominent mane. It is a social species, forming groups called prides. A lion's
        pride consists of a few adult males, related females, and cubs. Groups of female lions usually 
        hunt together, preying mostly on large ungulates. The lion is an apex and keystone predator; 
        although some lions scavenge when opportunities occur and have been known to hunt humans, the 
        species typically does not.
