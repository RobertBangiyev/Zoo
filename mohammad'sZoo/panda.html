        The giant panda, also known as the panda 
        bear (or simply the panda), is a bear species endemic to China. It is characterised by its bold black-and-white 
        coat and rotund body. The name "giant panda" is sometimes used to distinguish it from the red panda, a 
        neighboring musteloid. Though it belongs to the order Carnivora, the giant panda is a folivore, with bamboo 
        shoots and leaves making up more than 99% of its diet. Giant pandas in the wild will occasionally eat other 
        grasses, wild tubers, or even meat in the form of birds, rodents, or carrion. In captivity, they may receive 
        honey, eggs, fish, yams, shrub leaves, oranges, or bananas along with specially prepared food.
