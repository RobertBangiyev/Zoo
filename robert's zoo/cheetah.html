        <p>The cheetah (Acinonyx jubatus) is a large cat native to Africa and central Iran. It is the fastest land animal, estimated 
            to be capable of running at 80 to 128 km/h (50 to 80 mph) with the fastest reliably recorded speeds being 93 and 98 km/h 
            (58 and 61 mph), and as such has several adaptations for speed, including a light build, long thin legs and a long tail. 
            It typically reaches 67–94 cm (26–37 in) at the shoulder, and the head-and-body length is between 1.1 and 1.5 m 
            (3 ft 7 in and 4 ft 11 in). Adults weigh between 21 and 72 kg (46 and 159 lb). Its head is small and rounded, and has a 
            short snout and black tear-like facial streaks. The coat is typically tawny to creamy white or pale buff and is mostly 
            covered with evenly spaced, solid black spots. Four subspecies are recognised.
