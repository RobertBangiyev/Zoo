            The bald eagle (Haliaeetus leucocephalus) is a bird of prey found in North America. A sea eagle, it has two known 
            subspecies and forms a species pair with the white-tailed eagle (Haliaeetus albicilla), which occupies the same 
            niche as the bald eagle in the Palearctic. Its range includes most of Canada and Alaska, all of the contiguous 
            United States, and northern Mexico. It is found near large bodies of open water with an abundant food supply and 
            old-growth trees for nesting.

            The bald eagle is an opportunistic feeder which subsists mainly on fish, which it swoops down and snatches from the 
            water with its talons. It builds the largest nest of any North American bird and the largest tree nests ever recorded 
            for any animal species, up to 4 m (13 ft) deep, 2.5 m (8.2 ft) wide, and 1 metric ton (1.1 short tons) in weight. 
            Sexual maturity is attained at the age of four to five years.
