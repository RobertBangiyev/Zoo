            A rhinoceros (/raɪˈnɒsərəs/, from Greek rhinokerōs 'nose-horned', from rhis 'nose', and keras 'horn'), 
            commonly abbreviated to rhino, is a member of any of the five extant species (or numerous extinct species) of 
            odd-toed ungulates in the family Rhinocerotidae. (It can also refer to a member of any of the extinct species of 
            the superfamily Rhinocerotoidea.) Two of the extant species are native to Africa, and three to South and Southeast 
            Asia.

            Rhinoceroses are some of the largest remaining megafauna: all weigh at least one tonne in adulthood. 
            They have a herbivorous diet, small brains (400–600 g) for mammals of their size, one or two horns, 
            and a thick (1.5–5 cm), protective skin formed from layers of collagen positioned in a lattice structure. 
            They generally eat leafy material, although their ability to ferment food in their hindgut allows them to 
            subsist on more fibrous plant matter when necessary. Unlike other perissodactyls, the two African species of 
            rhinoceros lack teeth at the front of their mouths; they rely instead on their lips to pluck food.
